# Project Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This backend project, written in JavaScript and using the ES6 module system, is structured to enhance modularity and clarity. The codebase is divided into specific folders within the `routes` directory, each tailored to handle different aspects of the application, such as `claims` and `workItems`.

## Project Structure

### Routes Directory
- **Function**: Serves as the entry point for various API endpoints.
- **Implementation**: Contains subfolders for `claims` and `workItems`, each defining routes for handling respective entity requests.

### Controllers Directory
- **Role**: Responsible for processing incoming requests and formulating responses.
- **Key Controllers**:
  - `claimController`: Manages operations (CRUD) related to `claim` entities.
  - `workItemController`: Handles operations for `workItem` entities.
- **Behavior**: Controllers interact with models to execute business logic and communicate results back through routes.

### Models Directory
- **Purpose**: Manages data structures and interactions with the database.
- **Primary Models**:
  - `claimModel`: Defines the structure and database logic for `claim` entities.
  - `workItemModel`: Tailored for the data management of `workItem` entities.
- **Function**: Models encapsulate data handling, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

## Design Patterns and Conventions

- **Modularity**: Each component (route, controller, model) is designed to be self-contained, promoting easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division of roles - routes manage request routing, controllers handle business logic, and models deal with data.
- **Consistency**: Similar patterns and naming conventions are used across different entities (like `claims` and `workItems`), aiding in predictability and ease of understanding.
- **Error Handling**: Controllers are designed with `try/catch` blocks for robust error management.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Embraces asynchronous patterns, using `async/await` for handling database operations and other I/O tasks.

By following these architectural patterns and conventions, the project ensures a well-organized and understandable codebase, facilitating developers in navigating and contributing efficiently, particularly when working with different entities such as `claims` and `workItems`.
